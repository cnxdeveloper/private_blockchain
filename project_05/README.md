# Capstone: Real Estate Marketplace

The capstone will build upon the knowledge you have gained in the course in order to build a decentralized housing product. 

## Getting Started

In this project you will be minting your own tokens to represent your title to the properties. Before you mint a token, you need to verify you own the property. You will use zk-SNARKs to create a verification system which can prove you have title to the property without revealing that specific information on the property.

### Install

This repository contains Smart Contract code in Solidity (using Truffle) and tests (also using Truffle).

To install, download or clone the repo, then:

```npm install ``` ```truffle  compile ```

## Tests
```
truffle test
```

There are 10 tests, one for each allowed action.

```
it('should fail when minting when address is not contract owner', async function () {
            let exception = false;
            try{
                await this.contract.mint(account_three,5,{from: account_two});
            }catch(e){
                exception = true;
            }
            assert.equal(exception,true,"should fail when minting when address is not contract owner.");
        })
```
